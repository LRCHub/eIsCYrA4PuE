> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I want your two hands
Don't ever let me go
I want your two hands
Two hands on me
You don't need to tell me
you love me
Seventeen times in a day
(Yeah)
I don't need to hear I'm
your number one
And everybody's second place
You don't gotta shit-talk
your last girl
Sayin' she don't compare to me
(Yeah)
Baby,
I ain't saying you don't
know me well, it's
Just not the shit I need
'Cause they just words,
they don't mean much
(They don't mean much, no, no)
Need a little less talk
And a lot more touch
I just want your two hands on me
At all times, baby
If you let go
(I want your two hands)
Better put 'em right back fast
Want your two hands on me
Like my life needs savin'
Let 'em all know
(I want your two hands)
Can you do it like that? Yeah
You ain't gonna win with
the jewelry
Don't need the cute
fuckin' names
(No)
We don't gotta live out
of hotels
(Mm-mm)
We could do it in my room
all day
And I know you could spoil
me plenty more
But I don't really trust
that anymore
And I already got that bag
for free
(Ah)
But if you bought it,
then that's sweet
(Sweet)
Still, they're just things,
they don't mean much
(They don't mean much, no, no)
Seen a real good thing
Turn to real fucked up
I just want your two hands on me
At all times, baby
If you let go
(I want your two hands)
Better put 'em right back fast
Want your two hands on me
Like my life needs savin'
Let 'em all know
(I want your two hands)
Can you do it like that? Yeah
'Cause I want 'em all to see
You look good on top of me
At this time at night, I need
Not one, not three
(Yeah)
Just your two hands on me
Like my life needs savin'
Let 'em all know
(I want your two hands)
Can you do it like that? Yeah
I want your two hands
(Mm, woah)
Don't ever let me go
I want your two hands
Two hands on me
(I want your two)
I want your two hands
(Don't let me go)
Don't ever let me go
(I want your two hands)
I want your two hands
(Better put 'em right back)
Two hands on me
I just want your two hands on me
At all times, baby
If you let go
(I want your two hands)
Better put 'em right back fast
(Oh-oh)
Want your two hands on me
Like my life needs savin'
Let 'em all know
(I want your two hands)
Can you do it like that? Yeah
(Like that, like that)
'Cause I want 'em all to see
(Yeah)
You look good on top of me
At this time at night, I need
Not one, not three
Just your two hands on me
Like my life needs savin'
Let 'em all know
(I want your two hands)
Can you do it like that? Yeah
(Alright)
